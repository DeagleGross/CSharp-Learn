# Contributions
Feel free to contribute any topic in a Pull Request.  
Also if you want me to try to explain anything - create an issue. Sure, it will be fun for me to learn something new!

Please, note that every single example has to be stored in a separate directory and independent project with a README-file, explaining that topic. Comments in code a expected for better explanations :)
