# Memory management

There are two CIL instructions to allocate new objects:
- `newobj` creates a new object or new instance of a value type
- `newarr` created a new zero-based one-dimensional array

Even if one wants to manually manage memory, there is no possibility to due no command in CIL exists for that specific purpose.
