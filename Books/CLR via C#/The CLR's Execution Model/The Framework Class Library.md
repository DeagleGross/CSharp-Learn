# The Framework Class Library
Framework Class Library is a set of DLL assemblies that contain several thousand type definition in which each type exposes some functionality.

Possible apps one could build using these assemblies:
- Web services
- Web Forms/MVC Html-based applications
- Rich Windows GUI applications (using WPF or Windows Forms)
- Windows console applications
- Windows services
- Database stored procedures
- Component library (.NET Framework allows to build stand-alone assemblies)

Some General FCL Namespaces like `System.***` exposes functionality of special behaviour. It is obvious to understand what types are contained in each of these namespaces, i.e. `System.IO` types allow to do I\O and walking through directories and files.
